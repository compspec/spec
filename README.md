Compspec (Composition spec) is a number of specifications and models for comparing things. This means
that we take an abstract and simple approach to model complex systems as graphs (nodes
and relaionshps) and then can compare between graphs. There are several use cases here you 
can explore:

 - [asp](asp): simple model for comparison based on answer set programming 
 - [compatibility](compatibility): assessing for compatibility
