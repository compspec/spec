# Answer Set Programming Compspec

This specification is intended for comparison with answer set programming (ASP).
work I started in 2022 but did not continue pursuing. A comparison is defined by the [diffspec](spec.md#rules)
and you can also extract corpora (groups of facts) to use later. To continue your exploration, you
might want to read about:

 - [Background](background.md): of wanting or needing this specification.
 - [Composition Spec](spec.md): is the specification for a composition (a corpus of facts) and a diff (rules for comparison, "diffspec")
 - [Compspec (Python)](https://github.com/compspec/comspec): an implementation of this model.

## Examples

Or check out several examples and/or implementations:
