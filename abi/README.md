# ABI Compspec

This specification is intended for comparing application binary interfaces,
work I started in 2022 but did not continue pursuing. A comparison is defined by the [diffspec](spec.md#rules)
and you can also extract corpora (groups of facts) to use later. To continue your exploration, you
might want to read about:

 - [Background](background.md): of wanting or needing this specification.
 - [Composition Spec](spec.md): is the specification for a composition (a corpus of facts) and a diff (rules for comparison, "diffspec")

## Examples

Or check out several examples and/or implementations:

 - [asp](asp): Compspec asp is an example of generating a compspec with answer set programming.
