# Compatibility Compspec

We want to be able to assess the compatibility of an application or container with a host environment.
This project is underway, and (for the time being) you can find resources here:

 - [supercontainers/compspec](https://github.com/supercontainers/compspec) has compspec.json (the TBA format) we are prototyping
 - [supercontainers/compspec-go](https://github.com/supercontainers/compspec-go) is a tool for doing the extraction and checking.
 - [Proposal D](https://github.com/opencontainers/wg-image-compatibility/pull/9) is the proposal driving the above two.
